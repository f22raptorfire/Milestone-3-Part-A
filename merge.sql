Together they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

This introduction is based on one of the most popular and dynamic courses taught at Harvard\'s Kennedy School of Government. In each case students are cast as a trusted NSC staffer to President Obama or to another principal in the policy-making process.  Each case requires not only reexamining current U.S. strategy but also identifying alternative strategies for protecting and advancing national interests. In each of these cases which include a special two-week segment on the disclosures surrounding NSA surveillance and the trove of WikiLeaks documents of previously-secret American policymaking participants have to operate in the rough-and-tumble of a government whose deliberations are discombobulated by leaks reports about internal differences among policymakers and press analyses. Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct Strategic Options Memo that combines careful analysis and strategic imagination on the one hand with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support on the other.

(923,'ANTH207x: Introduction to Human Evolution','An overview of human evolutionary history viewed through the human fossil archaeological and genetic records.','As contemporary humans we are a product of our evolutionary past. That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record the materials preserved for archaeological study and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes the rise and fall of the Australopithecines the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.

Unit processes involved in the two treatment chains will be described as well as the physical chemical and biological processes involved. There will be an emphasis on water quality and the functionality of each unit process within the treatment chain.  After the course one should be able to recognise the process units describe their function and make simple design calculations on water treatment  plants (drinking and waste water).  Overall the course will teach the role of treatment technologies in providing adequate water supply and effective sanitation which are essential for human society and the safeguarding of public and environmental health. There is a global trend towards urbanisation with over 50% of humanity currently residing in urban areas. Water is invariably linked to urban functionality as industrial domestic and agricultural use. Essential services such as drinking water supply sanitation and wastewater treatment to protect surface water and groundwater resources need to be present in such environment. The provision of these essential urban water services present real challenges in many parts of the world today. Accessible fresh water resources suitable for drinking water and other ecosystem services is approximated to be 200000 km3 approximately 0.3% of the total freshwater resources and less than 0.01% of the total water on earth. These accessible freshwater resources are not equally distributed and many countries today are experiencing water scarcity which in turn affects community health and in many places water scarcity is the inhibiting factor for economic growth. This highlights the importance of conserving and protecting the accessible freshwater resources through the implementation of adequate treatment technologies combined with a robust infrastructure. Through utilising relevant treatment technologies to upgrade water to a quality suitable for subsequent use or discharge with more and more stringent effluent demands the urban water chain has the possibility to transform to an urban water cycle and improve interactions within the greater hydrological cycle.

(937,'CB22.1x: The Ancient Greek Hero','A survey of ancient Greek literature focusing on classical concepts of the hero and how they can inform our understanding of the human condition.','What is it to be human and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition That question is at the core of The Ancient Greek Hero which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging highly comparative way. The classical Greeks\' concepts of Heroes and the \"heroic\" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general. In Greek tradition a hero was a human male or female of the remote past who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans but on a much larger scale. Further despite their mortality heroes like the gods were objects of cult worship  a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course. The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue \"On Heroes\" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach\'s opera Tales of Hoffman to Ridley Scott\'s science fiction classic Blade Runner). The true hero of the course is the logos (\"word\") of reasoned expression as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or \"slow\") reading which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer\'s epics and ends with Plato\'s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations. Using modern technology and engaging texts The Ancient Greek Hero provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature its myths and its ritual practices.

Finally students learn how to apply Agile techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code a critical skill for professional programmers. Other topics covered in CS 169.2x include: How to form organize and manage small programming teams Introduction to design patterns: what they are and how to recognize opportunities to apply them Using Rails for more advanced features like third-party authentication and elegantly expressing design patterns that arise frequently in SaaS There will be three homework assignments: two programming assignments and one assignment about operations/deployment. There will also be several short quizzes. Note: Unlike CS 169.1x which has been offered multiple times both online and on-campus CS 169.2x is fresh new material. Although versions of it have been taught at UC Berkeley it has evolved significantly between offerings and this online version is essentially new. This is therefore an \"alpha\" version.

This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject including entanglement non-local correlations the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms including the quantum fourier transform period finding Shor\'s quantum algorithm for factoring integers as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems.

Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x the online equivalent of Berkeley\'s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member What if you can only reach a subset of the population   Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem.   The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed \"The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points\" or \"Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...\" then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl\'s school science project (seriously  she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.   The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods.

It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to any students who meet the prerequisites (see right) but is especially designed for teachers and those who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force and moves on to straight-line motion momentum mechanical energy rotational motion and angular momentum. Optional units include oscillations planetary orbits and a review of multi-concept problems. Why Take Our Course Our approach to mechanics is a unique one. Through worked examples and online texts we introduce a strategic overview of core concepts in mechanics. This overview couples with a new approach to problem-solving that will help you break down and solve multi-concept problems. By choosing a system of objects defining their interactions and deciding on a model to use to describe them you will come to solve physics problems more easily and more systematically. The road to \"easy\" goes through \"hard.\" This course is more challenging than a standard high school or introductory college physics offering. We will help you become a more expert problem solver and that process involves solving a variety of problems in many different ways with our new approach. The reward is stronger problem-solving ability that carries over to other areas in physics. Take this course to better organize your mechanics knowledge to prepare for AP or advanced standing exams to teach more effectively or if you enjoy attacking challenging problems! For Teachers If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics or to learn new approaches to teach your students we encourage you to sign up. Our approach has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness when it comes to preparing students for later courses. Teachers in the United States and especially in Massachusetts can receive extra benefit from this course.

(946,'CB22x: The Ancient Greek Hero','A survey of ancient Greek literature focusing on classical concepts of the hero and how they can inform our understanding of the human condition.','NOTE ABOUT OUR START DATE: Although the course was launched on March 13th it\'s not too late to start participating! New participants will be joining the course until registration closes on July 11. We offer everyone a flexible schedule and multiple paths for participation. You can work through the course videos and readings at your own pace to complete the associated exercises by August 26 the official course end date. Or you may choose to \"audit\" the course by exploring just the particular videos and readings that seem most suited to your interests. You are free to do as much or as little as you would like! Overview What is it to be human and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition That question is at the core of The Ancient Greek Hero which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging highly comparative way. The classical Greeks\' concepts of Heroes and the \"heroic\" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general. In Greek tradition a hero was a human male or female of the remote past who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans but on a much larger scale. Further despite their mortality heroes like the gods were objects of cult worship  a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course. The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue \"On Heroes\" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach\'s opera Tales of Hoffman to Ridley Scott\'s science fiction classic Blade Runner). The true hero of the course is the logos (\"word\") of reasoned expression as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or \"slow\") reading which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer\'s epics and ends with Plato\'s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations. Using modern technology and engaging texts The Ancient Greek Hero provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature its myths and its ritual practices.

In addition to the basic concepts of Electromagnetism a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course including: Lightning Electric Shock Treatment Electrocardiograms Metal Detectors Musical Instruments Magnetic Levitation Bullet Trains Electric Motors Radios TV Car Coils Superconductivity Aurora Borealis Rainbows Radio Telescopes Interferometers Particle Accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider Mass Spectrometers Red Sunsets Blue Skies Haloes around Sun and Moon Color Perception Doppler Effect Big-Bang Cosmology. You will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and a series of exams using multiple choice numerical and symbolic questions to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions that must be answered before advancing to the next lecture segment. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on interactive questions during the lectures (5%) homework problems and simulations (20%) three midterm exams (15% each) and the final exam (30%). Depending on what percentage of all the points you get your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%) B (70-85%) C (60-70%). At least 60% of the points must be obtained to qualify for a certificate of mastery. ABOUT THE LECTURES Lewin\'s lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs which were aired 24 hours per day were also frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT\'S OpenCourseWare iTunes U YouTube and Academic Earth. These lectures are being watched by about 5000 people daily from all over the world that\'s about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their class rooms and Bill Gates wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once and that he learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving.','https://www.edx.org/course/mit/8-02x/electricity-and-magnetism/608','http://youtube.com/watch?v=BxSLwndRNDI','2013-02-18',-1,'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/styles/course_tile_image/public/8.02x-Listing-Banner.jpg?itok=9W4ATdXI','','Edx'),
